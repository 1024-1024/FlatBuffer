This should result in a flatc executable\r\n* Now create your schema file with extension .fbs. Guide to write a schema can be found [here](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/flatbuffers_guide_writing_schema.html).And also have your sample json file.\r\n```sh\r\n$ ./flatc -j -b schema.fbs sample.json\r\n```\r\n* This will create few java file and one bin file. Java files are like model(POJO for flatBuffer) of your json.Place the java files in your application package and bin file in raw folder(bin file is only for testing as it is converted to byte that is to be passed to flatbuffer for testing).\r\n* Now we have to get flatbuffer jar file.\r\n```sh\r\n$ cd flatbuffers\r\n$ cd java\r\n$ mvn install\r\nThis will download all the dependencies.\r\n$ cd target\r\n```\r\n* Here you will get the flatbuffers-java-1.3.0-SNAPSHOT.jar file that you have to put it in your libs folder of android project.\r\n* For rest you can see my sample project.\r\n\r\n## Major steps:\r\n* Prepare your schema.fbs.\r\n* Have a sample json.\r\n* Build flatBuffer google project to generate your java files to be used in main application.\r\n* Generate java files.\r\n\r\n### Contact - Let's become friend\r\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/amitiitbhu)\r\n- [Github](https://github.com/amitshekhariitbhu)\r\n- [Medium](https://medium.com/@amitshekhar)\r\n- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/amit.shekhar.iitbhu)\r\n\r\n### License\r\n```\r\n   Copyright (C) 2016 Amit Shekhar\r\n\r\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\n   limitations under the License.\r\n```",
